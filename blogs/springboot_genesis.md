# Preface

Spring, Spring and Spring! The signficance of word is so prominent that it is difficult to assume modern Java application without it being talked about. And, the spring boot is one of family member whose popularity deserves independent writeup. In this document, the author talks about why it came and what value it brings on table.


# Genesis

Dated back, we were in the wold of EJB. The EJB has many good traits to solve buisness use cases but little bit convoluted and more demanding than it should have been. The result is that spring came into existence. The spring fraamework brought the power of EJB but with clean architecture, patterns and idioms. It came with below philoshy:


> Developer should spend time on writing business logic not on doing common tasks like creating objects, solving dependency. For this, adhere to guideline of spring application to enable the framweork do cross-application and common things.


They achieved this by bringing the following eco-system.

1. Automatic configuration—Spring Boot can automatically provide configuration for application functionality common to many Spring applications.
2. Starter dependencies—You tell Spring Boot what kind of functionality you need, and it will ensure that the libraries needed are added to the build.
3. The command-line interface—This optional feature of Spring Boot lets you write complete applications with just application code, but no need for a traditional project build.
4. The Actuator—Gives you insight into what’s going on inside of a running Spring Boot application.
