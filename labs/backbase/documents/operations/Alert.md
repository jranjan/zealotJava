# Overview

Alert is a critical element for notifying the operation team about the occurrence of some anomaly
and plays a significant role in quick turnaround in the remediation of system issues. This document
lists a set of alert(s) supported by xInterceptor, its interpretation and its remediation plan.

Metric(s) and alerts go hand to hand. The reader is expected to have a basic understanding of
metrics and alert eco-system supported, functional knowledge of service 
and metrics supported by it.
