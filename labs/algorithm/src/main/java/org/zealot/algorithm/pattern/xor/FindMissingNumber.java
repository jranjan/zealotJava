// The XOR trick: If we have a sequence of XOR operations a ^ b ^ c ^ ...,
// then we can remove all pairs of duplicated values without affecting the result.
// Commutativity allows us to re-order the applications of XOR so that the
// duplicated elements are next to each other. Since x ^ x = 0 and a ^ 0 = a,
// each pair of duplicated values has no effect on the outcome.
